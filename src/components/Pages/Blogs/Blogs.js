            Why are you using Firebase? What other options do you have to

              Firebase can be seen as a server-less backend for your mobile
              apps, web apps, etc. It is a service provided by Google. As an
              Android developer I use Firebase in most of my projects. It has
              many features like Realtime database, Cloud functions, Analytics,
              Crashlytics, Cloud Firestore, etc.

            Authentication
          </h3>
          <div>
            <p>1. Authentication verifies who the user is.</p>
            <p>
              2. Authentication works through passwords, one-time pins,
              biometric information, and other information provided or entered
              by the user.
            </p>
            <p>
              3. Authentication is the first step of a good identity and access
              management process.
            </p>
            <p>
              4. Authentication is visible to and partially changeable by the
              user.
            </p>
            <p>
              5. Example: By verifying their identity, employees can gain access
              to an HR application that includes their personal pay information,
              vacation time, and 401K data.
            </p>

            Authorization
          </h3>
          <div>
            <p>1. Authorization determines what resources a user can access.</p>
            <p>
              2. Authorization works through settings that are implemented and
              maintained by the organization.
            </p>
            <p>3. Authorization always takes place after authentication.</p>
            <p>4. Authorization isnâ€™t visible to or changeable by the user.</p>
            <p>
              5. Example: Once their level of access is authorized, employees
              and HR managers can access different levels of data based on the
              permissions set by the organization.
